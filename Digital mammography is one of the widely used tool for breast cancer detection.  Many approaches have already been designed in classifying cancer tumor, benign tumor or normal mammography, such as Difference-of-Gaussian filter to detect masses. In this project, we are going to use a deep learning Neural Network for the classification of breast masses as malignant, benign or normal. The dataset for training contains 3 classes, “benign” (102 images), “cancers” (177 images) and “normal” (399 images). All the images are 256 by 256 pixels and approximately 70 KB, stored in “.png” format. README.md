# -Mammography-classfication
Digital mammography is one of the widely used tool for breast cancer detection.
Many approaches have already been designed in classifying cancer tumor, benign 
tumor or normal mammography, such as Difference-of-Gaussian filter to detect masses.
In this project, we are going to use a deep learning Neural Network for the classification 
of breast masses as malignant, benign or normal. The dataset for training contains 3 classes, 
“benign” (102 images), “cancers” (177 images) and “normal” (399 images). All the images are 
256 by 256 pixels and approximately 70 KB, stored in “.png” format.
